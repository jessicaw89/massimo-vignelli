<h2>Why is Massimo Vignelli one of the most important icons in modern design?</h2>

        <h3 id="massimo-vignelli">Massimo Vignelli</h3>
    
<p>Massimo Vignelli, a well celebrated graphic and industrial designer from the 20th century, led by modernism and simplicity, his work ethic is based around the use of geometric design. Covering in nearly all fields of design, such as advertising, identity, product, packaging, interior and furthermore, he hoped in evolving a design aesthetic that would be known. Establishing a small design studio with his wife, Lella and Massimo Vignelli Office of Design and Architecture, as well as co-founding Unimark International design company in 1964, it became one of the largest design studios in the world, designing in a field of branding.  Especially, drawing attention on graphic systems and successfully transforming everyday needs by showcasing strength and functionality through a social value of design, and making an understanding of the Modern Movement.</p> 

<p>Throughout the Modern Movement in the 20th century, artists have been able to roam freely with their own styles and materials, forming art by mixing experiments with society and culture, and reflecting on realities of modern societies. The Movement was defined as the rejection of traditional arts and compressing them into abstractive art using different forms of shapes and colours, showcasing a new perspective in producing expressive, established designs.  This created an instinct for artists to reflect on certain subjects and personal experiences, challenging on how the world could handle and interpret. In either way, throughout this essay, learning about the works of Vignelli, he will help me take upon what the true essence of modernism is, understand how to adopt clearer possibilities and ideas in design, as well as understanding why he has changed the way designers think, but also, understand the impact he has made for all users of design.</p>

<p>The whole aspect that Massimo portrayed in graphic design was followed by designing for major companies (such as; American Airlines, Ford, Knolls, Bloomingdales etc), popularising the typeface “Helvetica”, and reshaping New York’s subway system.</p>

<h4 id="american-airlines">American Airlines:</h4>

<p>Branding identity is solely based on how a design can be interpreted through words and images, Vignelli, redesigned the look of the American Airlines in 1967, and was used for the next three decades. The branding of the logo showcases the use of “Helvetica”, simply by using letters of two As, adding colours of blue and red for American representation, as well as including a stylised eagle, known as the company’s main identity. However, it was revealed that Massimo refused to draw the eagle, causing threats which eventually made him add it in. Massimo expressed that in order to symbolise a new look, it is important to not “…stylise the eagle and make a cartoon out of it” (M. Vignelli), meaning to give the corporate identity “dignity”. This showcases structure he wanted to follow, by giving it an own sense of rule, conveying sensibility and simplicity that allows all designers to take upon on. And that worked best with Helvetica; the typeface has always given Massimo a sense of expression in incorporating fully into his character of work.</p>  

<p>Through the ‘AA’ logo, it helped revolve what mattered in creating brands, stating that clarity is stronger than complexity creating timelessness for brand design in the 1960s. This is until his logo was stripped away in 2013, causing backlash, particularly from Vignelli . Vignelli expressed that “There’s no need to change it. The logo doesn’t need change. The whole world knows it, and there’s a tremendous equity... I will not be here to make a bet, but this (new logo) won’t last another 25 years.” (M. Vignelli).  Reading his opinion, he must’ve not liked the new transition due to the history the logo has held for the company’s identity, and I find that understandable, mainly because the logo showcases the classic American Style, which has helped to capture the long decades the company has endured, and changing the identity could mean that it is a end of an era for a impactful design. However, although the new logo may look modern and help to fit the era, I feel like Massimo’s logo helped capture what a good design is, especially by using simple elements and turning it into a form of individual identity, and scraping it takes away the past, however, bringing in the a new present can commemorate a new beginning.</p>

<h4>New York Subway System</h4>

<p>Before the changes of New York’s Subway System, it caused great complexity, three systems were merged into one, which was seen as a mess, providing no clear principles in place, making user experience for city-goers hard to travel.   This led the New York City Transit Authority to propose a commission to Unimark to develop a new, easy and clearer system to fix New York’s transit. During the start of the process, Bob Noorda and Massimo Vignelli went through an analysis on four major stations and stated that the simple goal is to make New York easier to read and navigable.  In 1972, the release of the new system came out, displaying an array of colours, each line having its own individual colour, a dot for each station, giving its main concept by Massimo called “dot to dot”. As for the making of the signages, coloured discs identified the trains and tracks with specific letters and numbers as communicational panels. The navigation system became “A system of logic” (M. Vignelli), securing needs for users, but also helping to redefine and reshape the city.  In my view, It is important to secure a design identity which enables expression to be displayed, it enables viewers to capture how they want to be foreseen, and Vignelli has given this to New York, creating a new era and chapter in identity for them and also, design itself. Although the map system was replaced to a more geographical look, due to inaccurate geographic locations, the map was considered as the best in the design community.</p>  

<p>The structure of the navigation system has certainly given an impact of how design can be empowered throughout lives of users and viewers, making a systematic design would make experiences more understanding and enjoyable to use. Focusing on the design view, even though it was replaced, I think the map system reflected well especially as Massimo’s map system (New York) is the most recognised and given the utmost recognition. Showcasing the clarity of how simple geometric shapes can be used in different ways, earns the title of benefiting what designers can take upon, especially when the next map system in 1979 was influenced by Vignelli’s work. This continuously shows that Vignelli will always be considered as the creator who started this trend, encouraging designers to take upon, follow and use to generate new ideas.

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>        
        
<p>To summarise, Massimo Vignelli dominates a large field in design culture from the past, as well as continuing to do so in the present, his design structure helped to enforce the true meaning behind value of great design, through brand recognition, needs in society and building typeface structure. The sense of enforcing reality makes up modernism as a whole, replacing unsuccessful to successful, improving the visual outlook which viewers/designers strive for, creating an image that would be liable in the end. He has contributed in showing responsibility of a good artist expressing that; “The life of a designer is a life of fight: fight against the ugliness.” (M. Vignelli), this explains that in order to complete a design, challenges must be made and be surpassed, to find the solution that would change and improve visual perspective. As for myself, finding solutions expands and opens a clearer mindset, and Massimo’s creations is the prime of shaping design in society, particularly securing a spot for himself that specialises in delivering communicational methods in a different aspect, which is the main core of design. Knowing exactly what the needs of users are, especially visualising it in a physical aspect, as well as guaranteeing the main reason behind good design is how it can influenced for decades, and he has successfully captured that in Modern Design, which concludes why he is one of most important icons in modern design.</p>
